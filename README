    * On CentOS, to install zlib:
        sudo yum install zlib-devel 


How to compile
  1. Compile with multi-threading support (default): make
  2. Compile without multi-threading support (if you are on very old systems): make openmp=no
  3. Compile without zlib (if you can not install zlib): make zlib=no
